Then- it gets ever sensual with musk- rose- and patchouli as night takes its hold. Princess is like sipping on a green tea matcha with a tip of ginger on the nose for sassy spice- followed by a little marshmallow sweet at the end. Kissing is a luscious remix of floral and gourmand notes; it speaks to the most perfect sport for couples with incredible chemistry. Finally- Adults is a very sensual scent with a top note of fig milk that hits soft like naked skin- while cedarwood and vanilla prolong the experience into much more than six minutes of pleasure.This set contains:- 4 x 0.4 oz/ 1.2 mL Eau de Parfum in After Sunset- Princess- Kissing- Adults About the Fragrance: My Kind of Love is a collection of daring and delicious fragrances that represents a new exploration of Kilian’s unconventional take on perfume. What binds the collection is an entirely different olfactive structure than that of the perfumes in Kilian’s main opus of fragrances.,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,Princess:Alcohol Denat.- Aqua - Water - Eau- Fragrance (Parfum)- Benzyl Salicylate- Linalool- Coumarin- Limonene- Citral- Benzyl Benzoate- Geraniol- Benzyl Alcohol- Dilauryl Thiodipropionate- Bht- Benzoic Acid .Kissing:Alcohol Denat.- Aqua - Water - Eau- Fragrance (Parfum)- Linalool- Limonene- Benzyl Alcohol- Hydroxycitronellal- Citronellol- Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone- Farnesol- Citral- Geraniol- Benzyl Benzoate- Benzyl Salicylate- Isoeugenol- Bht .

Scent Type: Classic Florals

Key Notes: Mandarin- Musk- Violet- Rose Absolute

Fragrance Description: Acqua di Parma's Rosa Nobile fragrance celebrates the preciousness and elegance of the rose- the queen of flowers. The exquisite fragrance opens with soft- vibrant notes of Sicilian mandarin and Calabrian bergamot. The heart reveals velvety accents of peony- violet- and lily of the valley- which perfectly complement the richness of the centifolia rose from Italy. The fragrance concludes with a sublime dry down of cedarwood- ambergris- and musk. Refined and timeless- Rosa Nobile celebrates the beauty and allure of innate feminine charm.

About the Bottle: This festive Rosa Nobile fragrance layering collection is presented in a limited-edition gift box beautifully illustrated by the Italian artist Gio Pastori.

This set contains:
- 3.4 oz/ 100 mL Eau de Parfum- 2.6 oz/ 75 g Body Cream- 2.5 oz/ 75 mL Shower Gel

About the Fragrance: All Acqua Di Parma products are handcrafted in Italy where the artisanal tradition is handed down from generation to generation.
",Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,unknown,1,0,1,0

Intensely woody and masculine- its fragrance takes hold and leaves a lasting impression. Artfully crafted in a juxtaposition of raw sophistication- Dior Homme is a man confident in both his strength and tenderness.About the Bottle: The Dior Homme bottle has been stylishly reinvented with a sleek and modern design. With light- crystal-clear glass- this sculpted block is an expression of simple and understated elegance- revealing its essential beauty: the fragrance.About the Fragrance: ""The signature of this composition is an overdose of sensual woods. The scent of this new Dior Homme gets straight to the point; it claims a frank- solid simplicity. It is luminous and appealing- but also conceals an enveloping softness.""—François Demachy- Dior Perfumer-Creator",Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent.

- Vitamin F: Soothing fatty acids (linolenic and linoleic) play a vital role in maintaining hydration levels- improving skin texture and suppleness- reducing redness- and improving acid-mantle strength. - Niacinamide: AKA vitamin B3- niacinamide has a wide range of benefits- most notably its ability to improve signs of aging (fine lines- wrinkles- loss of firmness) as well as uneven tone and texture; research has demonstrated that niacinamide- even in low concentrations- can help strengthen a compromised skin barrier- boost skin’s synthesis of ceramides and cholesterol—both essential substances in barrier health and elasticity—and improve skin’s defenses against water loss.	
 Ingredient Callouts: This product is vegan and cruelty-free- and comes in recyclable packaging. What Else You Need to Know: Barrier-supporting ingredients niacinamide- sodium PCA- plant squalane- ceramides- omega fatty acids- and antioxidants rehydrate hungover- parched skin- making it soft and supple- improving signs of damage and uneven texture and tone. Vitamin F beads deliver extra emollience and soothing hydration. This product is free of essential oils- silicones- fragrance and PEGs. Irritant-free. Drunk Elephant difference: Drunk Elephant is clean- but in their opinion- ""clean"" is not enough when it comes to caring for skin. They make ""Clean Compatible"" skincare. Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status- but instead choose based on biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils- drying alcohols- silicones- chemical sunscreens- fragrances/dyes- and SLS) making them- in their opinion- appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see- and when entirely removed from one’s routine- (""a clean break"")- skin can reset and return to a healthy- balanced state. It is equally- if not more- important what they leave out of the products as what they put in. This ingredient-elimination diet (think Whole30 for your face) inspired the #barewithus Instagram movement- a collection of bare-faced selfies chronicling the Drunk Elephant journeys of people who have found success using the line and renewed confidence in their own skin. When formulating their products- Drunk Elephant focuses on biocompatibility- pH levels- and safety- always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels and remain respectful and always supportive of skin’s acid mantle. Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.Clean at SephoraClean at Sephora is formulated without a list of over 50 ingredients- including sulfates (SLS and SLES)- parabens- phthalates- and more. For the full list- check out the Ingredients tab.",Suggested Usage:-Apply four or five pumps of F-Balm™ as the last step in your nighttime routine. -May be worn to bed as an overnight mask. ­-Also can be layered over Virgin Marula Oil for an extra shot of absorbable moisture. -Tip: Try using F-Balm™ on top of T.L.C.

A more intense interpretation of the Eau de Parfum. The crisp of cherry plum- enriched by the fruity facets of davana and warm- sensual oak moss. This woody chypre is a more intense version of the original composition. The oakmoss remains at the vibrant heart of Nomade- but here it reveals an unexpected refinement. The sumptuous texture of a sweet- Mirabelle plum brings a juicy dimension to the scent. A sensuousness enhanced by the fruity- aromatic inflections of velvety davana. A wind of liberty- warmed by the creamy- woody richness of soft sandalwood.About the Bottle: For this intense version- the Nomade bottle is adorned in warm colors- refined materials and luxurious details. Chic contrasts among the graphic lines of the collar- golden studs and hazelnut leather all echo the look of the Maison accessories.,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,Alcohol  Denat.- Parfum/Fragrance- Aqua/Water/Eau- Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate- Octocrylene- Benzyl Salicylate- Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone- Linalool- Benzophenone-3- Ethylhexyl Salicylate- Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane- Coumarin- Limonene- Geraniol- Citral- Alcohol- Eugenol- Tris(Tetramethylhydroxypiperidinol) Citrate- Citronellol- Farnesol- Bht- FD&C Red No. 4 (Ci 14700)- FD&C Yellow No. 6 (Ci 15985)- FD&C Blue No. 1 (Ci 42090).,1,0,0,0

Underlying it all are warm tones of amber- caramel- vanilla- sandalwood- and praline.A glamorous girl who is always the life of the party- the Viva La Juicy girl finds couture in the everyday and lives life with viva.This set contains:- 3.4 oz/ 100 mL Eau de Parfum - 0.33 oz/ 9.75 mL Eau de Parfum- 4.2 oz/ 124.2 mL Body Soufflé,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,Eau de Parfum:Alcohol Denat.

Wisteria Blue- blends delicate notes of French wisteria with the essence of Bulgarian rose- imperial jasmine- and fresh watery nuances. Indigo enhances Moroccan tea- Kashmir wood- and black cardamom with hints of wild fig and bergamot. Dahlia & Vines- where dewy daffodils- peony- and rose are blended with the essence of garden vines—this combination reveals a romantic floral that exudes elegance- grace- and luxury.Wild Poppy includes luscious aromas of pear- raspberry- and apricot infused with hints of Himalayan jasmine and Rose de Grasse. Midnight Fleur blends exotic wood- patchouli- and black amber with sensual notes of night-blooming jasmine and vanilla orchid. Black Tulip- nuances black amber plum with the aroma of patchouli- pink pepper- and Japanese violet for a scent that is as provocative as it is seductive and alluring. Citrine has the dewy softness of lotus flower and freesia set against sparkling citrus notes and hints of precious woods. About the Bottle: Inspired by the works of 18th Century British artist Mrs. Mary Delany- NEST Fragrance’s founder Laura Slatkin collaborated with master perfumers to translate these works of art into luxurious fragrances that capture the essence of each of the botanicals that adorn the products' striking packaging.This set contains:- 8 x 0.1 oz/ 3 mL Eau de Parfum in Sunkissed Hibiscus- Wisteria Blue- Indigo- Dahlia & Vines- Wild Poppy- Midnight Fleur- Black Tulip- Citrine.,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,Sunkissed Hibiscus:Alcohol Denat.- Fragrance (Parfum)- Water/Aqua/Eau- Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate- Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane- Ethylhexyl Salicylate.Wisteria Blue:Alcohol Denat- Fragrance- Pentaerythrithyl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate- Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate- Hexyl Cinnamal- Butylphenyl Methylpropional- Linalool- Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone- Benzyl Alcohol- Benzyl Benzoate- Benzyl Salicylate- D-Limonene- Farnesol- Geraniol- Eugenol- Citral- Hydroxycitronellal- Citronellol.Indigo: Alcohol Denat.- Fragrance- Water- Cinnamal- Limonene- Linalool- Geraniol- Citronellol- Citral- Benzyl Alcohol- Coumarin.Dahlia & Vines:Alcohol Denat.- Fragrance- Water- Benzyl Salicylate- Butylphenyl Methylpropional- Benzyl Alcohol- Limonene- Linalool- Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone- Butylphenyl Methylpropional- Citral- Citronellol- Geraniol- Methyl 2-Octynoate.Midnight Fleur:Alcohol Denat.- Fragrance- Benzyl Salicylate- Butylphenyl Methylpropional- Benzyl Alcohol- Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde- Limonene- Coumarin- Benzyl Benzoate- Farnesol- Linalool.Black Tulip:Alcohol Denat.- Fragrance- Water- Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone- Benzyl Alcohol- Benzyl Benzoate- Benzyl Salicylate- Butylphenyl Methylpropional- Citral- Citronellol- Coumarin- Eugenol- Geraniol- Limonene- Linalool.Citrine:Alcohol Denat.- Fragrance- Water- BHT- Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate- Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane- Ethylhexyl Salicylate- Benzyl Alcohol- Benzyl Salicylate- Citral- Citronellol- Geraniol- Hexyl Cinnamal- Hydroxycitronellal- Limonene- Linalool.,0,1,1,0

Fragrance Description: This mouthwatering fragrance captures the essence of succulent pear nectar and the radiant warmth of a Summer’s day.

About the Bottle: CLEAN Reserve is a farm-to-fragrance collection crafted with sustainably sourced ingredients and eco-conscious packaging. Inspired by CLEAN Reserve’s partnership with Earth Day Network to help protect endangered bees- this limited-edition packaging is adorned with a bee to raise awareness and create some buzz.	

About the Fragrance: Radiant Nectar is crafted with sustainable ambrette harvested by farmers in El Salvador to help support education programs for the farmers and their communities. Additionally- in honor of Earth Day’s 50th anniversary- CLEAN Reserve is sponsoring the Protect Our Species campaign to help protect bees.Clean at Sephora
Clean at Sephora is formulated without a list of over 50 ingredients- including sulfates (SLS and SLES)- parabens- phthalates- and more. For the full list- check out the Ingredients tab.
","Suggested Usage:
-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. 
-After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. 
-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. 
-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent.

Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil.

Nice to Meet You™- a cleanser and moisturizer duo that are skin’s introduction to Drunk Elephant. 

Skin Type: Normal- Dry- Combination- and Oily 

Skincare Concerns: Dryness- Dullness and Uneven Texture- and Loss of Firmness and Elasticity 

 Ingredient Callouts: This product is vegan and cruelty-free.

What Else You Need to Know: A makeup-removing butter cleanser that leaves skin balanced and nurtured- together with a shot of protein-rich moisture for improved tone- texture- and firmness. Now take #acleanbreak.

 Free of essential oils- silicones- fragrance and PEGs. Irritant-free.
Drunk Elephant Difference: Drunk Elephant is clean- but in their opinion- “clean” is not enough when it comes to caring for skin. They make “Clean Compatible” skincare. Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status- but instead choose based on biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the “Suspicious 6” in their products (essential oils- drying alcohols- silicones- chemical sunscreens- fragrances/dyes- and SLS) making them- in their opinion- appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see and when entirely removed from one’s routine (“a clean break”)- skin can reset and return to a healthy- balanced state. It is equally- if not more- important what we leave out of the products as what we put in. This ingredient-elimination diet inspired the #barewithus Instagram movement- a collection of bare-faced selfies chronicling the Drunk Elephant journeys of people who have found success using the line and renewed confidence in their own skin. When formulating the products- they focus on biocompatibility- pH levels- and safety- always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels and remain respectful and always supportive of skin’s acid mantle.
 
Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.

It is a fragrance for a strong- passionate- self-confident man who is deeply in touch with his emotions.,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,Alcohol Denat.

Gold chains around the neck are reminiscent of the iconic YSL it-bags- and the design is completed with the timeless Yves Saint Laurent logo.This set contains:- 1.7 oz/ 50 mL Eau de Parfum- 0.3 oz/ 10 mL Eau de Parfum,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,unknown,0,1,1,0

Scent Type: Warm & Sweet GourmandsKey Notes: Bergamot- Pistachio- Coco De Mer
Fragrance Description: This silky and lightweight body oil captures the sultry effect of sunkissed summer skin and tempts the senses with a fragrance of scorching sensuality. It illuminates the skin with shimmers of gold and platinum leaf. 
About the Fragrance: The captivating fragrance wraps a bouquet of white florals in a golden- amber-sandalwood embrace as tempting as a white-sand beach- as irresistible as the perfect tan.",Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,Ethylhexyl Palmitate- Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride- Isohexadecane- Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil- Fragrance (Parfum)- Silica- Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil- Calcium Sodium Borosilicate- Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil- Tin Oxide- Tocopherol- Tocopheryl Acetate- Bht- Phenoxyethanol- Butylphenyl Methylpropional- Limonene- Benzyl Alcohol- Linalool- Benzyl Salicylate- Benzyl Benzoate- Coumarin- Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone- Isoeugenol- Citral- Geraniol- Anise Alcohol- Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891)- Iron Oxides (Ci 77491).

Much like you choose ingredients for your daily smoothie based on your body’s cravings- pick products for AM/PM skincare smoothies based on how your skin feels. Listen to your skin- it doesn’t always need the same thing.Drunk Elephant Difference: Drunk Elephant is clean- but in their opinion- “clean” is not enough when it comes to caring for skin. They make “Clean Compatible” skincare. Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status- but instead choose based on biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the “Suspicious 6” in their products (essential oils- drying alcohols- silicones- chemical sunscreens- fragrances/dyes- and SLS) making them- in their opinion- appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see and when entirely removed from one’s routine (“a drunk break”)- skin can reset and return to a healthy- balanced state. It is equally- if not more- important what we leave out of the products as what we put in. This ingredient-elimination diet inspired the #barewithus Instagram movement- a collection of bare-faced selfies chronicling the Drunk Elephant journeys of people who have found success using the line and renewed confidence in their own skin. When formulating the products- they focus on biocompatibility- pH levels- and safety- always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels and remain respectful and always supportive of skin’s acid mantle.Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.Free of essential oils- silicones- fragrance- and PEGs. Irritant-free. This Set Contains:- 1 oz/ 30 mL Beste™ No.9 Jelly Cleanser- 0.27 oz/ 8 mL Virgin Marula Luxury Facial Oil- 0.27 oz/ 8 mL C-Firma™ Day Serum- 0.27 oz/ 8 mL B-Hydra™ Intensive Hydration Serum- 0.5 oz/ 15 mL Protini™ Polypeptide Cream- 0.5 oz/ 15 mL Umbra Sheer™ Physical Daily Defense SPF 30- 0.27 oz/ 8 mL T.L.C.

- Detangling comb
- Smoothing nozzle

",Suggested Usage:Dyson smoothing nozzle:-Dries hair gently with a smooth- wide airflow- allowing you to dry and style at the same time. This can be used to rough up dry hair. -Attach the nozzle vertically- which will gently move the hair from side-to-side- helping lift the hair. Think of this as fanning your hair with the nozzle standing upright. -To finish your style- rotate the nozzle to point air flow down (switch to horizontal) the hair shaft- using your fingers or a brush to guide it. -Consider switching to a lower heat setting to avoid over-drying the hair.Dyson styling concentrator: -High-velocity- focused air that lets you style one section at a time–without worrying about disturbing the rest.-Rotate the styling concentrator to match the direction you’re styling in. -Use a round brush to guide your hair and create your style. Dyson diffuser: -Engineered to disperse air evenly around each of your curls. Simulates natural drying to help reduce frizz and improve definition.-To start- don’t comb or brush your hair once washed; you don't want to interrupt your hair’s natural curl. Tip: comb it out while you condition and you should be good to go.-Gather your hair in the diffuser- starting at the tips. -Very gently push the hair upwards. -The trick is to move your natural curls as little as possible- so try not to brush or touch your hair and stick to the lowest airflow setting.,unknown,1,0,1,0

The couture elegance is made of three qualities of jasmine which bring a luxurious femininity when blended with vanilla bourbon- the most expensive extract in the world. This mix is twisted with a radiant trio of modern wood- which gives an edgy touch reminiscent of Rome street culture.About the Bottle: The bottle is designed with the iconic Valentino stud- the signature of Valentino Couture- which is inspired by Roma architecture.This set contains:- 1 oz/ 30 mL Eau de Parfum- 3.4 oz/ 100 mL Eau de ParfumAbout the Fragrance: This couture- floriental fragrance is made of three Jasmine flowers and accord- then blended with vanilla bourbon—one of the most expensive ingredients in modern perfumery—and twisted with notes of pink pepper and a woody overtone.,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,unknown,0,0,0,0

Skin Type: Normal- Dry- Combination- and Oily
Formulation: Cream
Highlighted Ingredients:
- Ultra-Mild Surfactant Blend: A stack of gentle cleansing agents- including coconut-based surfactants rich in fatty acids- that work together to create a rich foam that effectively lifts dirt and other substances from skin without stripping or drying.		
- Marula Oil: Super-absorbable oil- high in critical antioxidants and omegas 6 and 9- helps moisturize- nourish- and rejuvenate skin for a youthful-looking glow.		
- Sacha Inchi Seed Oil: Extracted from the seeds of the sacha inchi fruit- this oil is used for its potential to moisturize and soothe irritated skin; these benefits are attributed to the high concentration of antioxidant polyphenols- omega 6 (aka linoleic) and omega 3 (linolenic) fatty acids that sacha inchi seed oil contains.

Drunk Elephant is clean- but in their opinion- ""clean"" is not enough when it comes to caring for skin. They make ""Clean Compatible"" skincare. Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status- but instead choose based on biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils- drying alcohols- silicones- chemical sunscreens- fragrances/dyes- and SLS) making them- in their opinion- appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see- and when entirely removed from one’s routine- (""a clean break"")- skin can reset and return to a healthy- balanced state. It is equally- if not more- important what they leave out of the products as what they put in. This skin-elimination diet (think Whole30 for your face) inspired the #barewithus Instagram movement- a collection of bare-faced selfies chronicling the Drunk Elephant journeys of people who have found success using the line and renewed confidence in their own skin. When formulating their products- Drunk Elephant focuses on biocompatibility- pH levels- and safety- always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels and remain respectful and always supportive of skin’s acid mantle.

Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.
Clean at SephoraClean at Sephora is formulated without a list of over 50 ingredients- including sulfates (SLS and SLES)- parabens- phthalates- and more.

Drunk Elephant is clean- but in their opinion- ""clean"" is not enough when it comes to caring for skin. They make ""Clean Compatible"" skincare. Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status- but instead choose based on biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils- drying alcohols- silicones- chemical sunscreens- fragrances/dyes- and SLS) making them- in their opinion- appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see- and when entirely removed from one’s routine- (""a clean break"")- skin can reset and return to a healthy- balanced state. It is equally- if not more- important what they leave out of the products as what they put in. This skin-elimination diet (think Whole30 for your face) inspired the #barewithus Instagram movement- a collection of bare-faced selfies chronicling the Drunk Elephant journeys of people who have found success using the line and renewed confidence in their own skin. When formulating their products- Drunk Elephant focuses on biocompatibility- pH levels- and safety- always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels and remain respectful and always supportive of skin’s acid mantle.

Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.

Drunk Elephant difference:
Drunk Elephant is clean- but in their opinion- ""clean"" is not enough when it comes to caring for skin. They make ""Clean Compatible"" skincare. Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status- but instead choose based on biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils- drying alcohols- silicones- chemical sunscreens- fragrances/dyes- and SLS) making them- in their opinion- appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see- and when entirely removed from one’s routine- (""a clean break"")- skin can reset and return to a healthy- balanced state. It is equally- if not more- important what they leave out of the products as what they put in. This ingredient-elimination diet (think Whole30 for your face) inspired the #barewithus Instagram movement- a collection of bare-faced selfies chronicling the Drunk Elephant journeys of people who have found success using the line and renewed confidence in their own skin. When formulating their products- Drunk Elephant focuses on biocompatibility- pH levels- and safety- always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels and remain respectful and always supportive of skin’s acid mantle.

Clinique Happy™ Perfume Spray delights with a hint of citrus- a wealth of flowers- a mix of emotions. Continue the happy experience with rich- hydrating Body Cream and on-the-go purse spray. This set contains:- 1.7 oz/ 50 mL Clinique Happy™ Perfume Spray- 0.34 oz/ 10 mL Clinique Happy™ Perfume Spray- 2.5 oz/ 75 mL Clinique Happy™ Body Cream,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,Clinique Happy™ Perfume Spray: Alcohol Denat. - Clinique Happy Perfume (Parfum) - Water\Aqua\Eau - Butylphenyl Methylpropional - Benzyl Alcohol - Hydroxycitronellal - Limonene - Citronellol - Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone - Linalool - Citral - Geraniol.

Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil.
